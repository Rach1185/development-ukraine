					<h4> Our Story </h4>
					<p> Born of the meeting between development and tech, Forward Ukraine came into being when an international development professional strolled onto the DC General Assembly campus in June 2015 with no web development skills, but a big dream. With the sense that there was still so much to do, Rachel Grossman came to class not just to learn to code, but to code with a purpose.
					</p>
					<p>That purpose was to bridge the gaps between organizations and people with a love for Ukraine across the globe to maximize efforts and share best practices. And that was how Forward Ukraine saw its first moments, a sparkle in a returned volunteer’s eye.
					</p>
					<p>In just a few short months, the project launched from nothing to something. In September 2015, Ashley Nguyen, also a returned Peace Corps Volunteer and program officer at the International Center for Journalists, jumped on board, proving to be an invaluable addition to the two-person team – mastering Mapbox and a budding JavaScript whizz. Together, we are Forward Ukraine – connecting organizations with each other and to broaden horizons by opening up the ways ordinary citizens can offer support to the cause.</p>
					<p>While we hope to expand our reach to connect those across the world with a love for Ukraine, growth is not the objective; rather, getting the most value for each dollar, each euro, each pound, each hryvnia, spent on building an independent prosperous Ukraine is the driving force.
