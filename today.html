					<p> Nearly a year and a half after the EuroMaidan protests, Ukraine’s political and economic struggles have continued. The ongoing challenges of the overhaul needed after the exciting and rapid transition has left the development community tripping over the what next of aid support to Ukraine. In pushing forward to combat corruption, reduce barriers to doing business, and create space for public-private dialogue, the new administration has faced overwhelming interconnected obstacles. However, the largest segment of official development assistance (ODA) has been devoted to economic infrastructure – a solid approach. Meanwhile, the steady increase in loans has further indicated that ODA is increasingly a minority shareholder in international development everywhere. Considering this, an overarching goal of the new SDGs is to maximize the value of ODA by turning those billions to trillions through domestic resource mobilization (DRM). In fact, DRM is the most important factor of sustainable development finance. But it is contingent on an improved regulatory environment to reduce costs and maximize outcomes. In this sense, ODA spent on economic infrastructure and regulatory reform is ODA well spent.

				<p> Still, major reform is needed across sectors, primarily regarding energy subsidy reform. According to the IMF, Ukraine is a top subsidizer, meaning that reform would release significant pressure from the public budget, and the revenue gain from eliminating energy subsidies would yield ~ $2.9 trillion back to the budget. In this sense, it is a public expenditure efficiency issue. Gains are substantial. With energy subsidy reform comes a large and growing pool of potential domestic resources, with that revenue put back into the economy. Mobilizing these domestic resources is where donors should focus – in Ukraine, that means diversification. The opportunity is now.

				<p>Just today Ukraine declared that it will stop buying Russian gas. Ukraine now has the chance to embark on development unprecedented in its history, but this requires a number of serious steps, including the concerted effort to improve the regulatory environment and direct tax policy reform in order to incentivize the creation of alternative energy sources and spur innovation. Though this is where the money is going, it’s a mess. Further, done without substantial input from citizens, continued reform leaves room for error if the business community is not involved. In establishing regulations, it is vital to note the business perspective on potential burdens to entering the market. While there has in fact been progress on pro-SME legislative reform in Ukraine and the legal framework underpinning Ukraine’s business environment has been improved, the effort requires broader buy-in within and across aid organizations.

			<p>Resource mobilization is only as strong as political will partnered with combined assistance efforts. Some of the most underfunded sectors include education and access to information, which, aligned with current programs, would make it simpler for citizens to find information about programs and provide input. If each aid organization provided well-designed information and contacts in one location, citizens could provide their input into policy reform. Only then will it be clear to Ukrainian citizens how they can, and must, contribute.
